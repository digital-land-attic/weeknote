This was the original website for the DLUHC Planning Data team, previously known as the Digital Land team.

Our platform is now in public beta and has a new site: [https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/](planning.data.gov.uk)

Data and information about our work has moved to the new site, we no longer regularly update this website but you can still read our old weeknotes and blogs on this site. Working in the open has always been one of our team values.
